# Node.js REST API for OMR Processing
[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud. We provide a series of [SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud). Along with that, you can get [binaries](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases) to start working immediately and recognize various OMR forms.

Developers can embed [optical recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mark_recognition) in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using [Aspose.OMR API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/omr-api-specification/) in your project.

## OMR Processing Features

- Perform recognition of scanned photos and images for OMR operations.
- Ability to perform OMR on rotated & perspective (within 25 deg) photos.
- Extract & recognize human-marked data from scanned tests, exams, surveys, etc.
- Supports the export of OMR results to CSV file format.
- Use textual markup to generate OMR templates, generate surveys, and test sheets.
- Availability of GUI application for managing OMR templates.
- Specify the number of OMR based questions & answers in the template.
- Availability of GUI OMR editor as a cloud client.
- Provide JSON rules to perform OMR answer grading.
- Clip an area of interest from an image, save it as JPEG & perform OMR on it.
- Perform highly accurate optical mark recognition (OMR).

## Save OMR As
CSV

## Read OMR Formats
JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF

## Quickstart

You can perform tasks out of the box without writing a single line of code with our [GUI client](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases). You can also refer to the [client documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/creating-omr-template-and-extracting-data/).

## Requirements.

NodeJS v4+

## Installation


- Clone `aspose-omr-cloud` **with submodules**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-nodejs.git --recurse-submodules
```

- Run following script:

```sh
npm install && npm run-script build
```
## Optional requirements

To take full advantage of Aspose.OMR for Cloud, _asposestoragecloud_ is required. Just run `npm install asposestoragecloud`.

## Usage
### Receive Cloud Keys
Aspose.Cloud credentials are required to use Aspose.OMR for Cloud API. You can acquire App SID and App Key by registrating at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud). It will take only a couple of minutes.

### Update Submodules

In case you are missing submodules use the following git commands to initialize and update them:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### Code example
You can check out [OMR Demo](demo) project to get started with Aspose.OMR for Cloud.
